Last night, while laying in bed, I couldn't help but pick up on a low audible frequency. The second night in a row. "What is that?", I wonder--my anxiety beginning to multiply.
The second night in a row, but far from the second time in all. I hear this vibration, coming from what appears to be, just outside my window. My limbs, tired from the day of labor; my bones, weak from the assaulting resonance that leaves me feeling uneasy.

I finally position myself upright in bed. It's 3:04 AM, why is there light in the sky? My left foot reaches the ground first, but when both feet make contact, I begin slipping through the floor. 

I would fall for some time, attempting to scream but only releasing the muffled sounds of a drowning man. Why is this happening to me? 


Still falling, I start to think about that noise again. That eerie, natively offputting tone that drove my body here. It manipulated me into placing my feet exactly so, where it's anomalistic nature must've ensnared me. Caught in this bind of shifting space, folding inward on myself until I no longer recognize the thoughts circling my own temple.

But it's at this point--at this point, I broke through to the other side. And that other side was just behind my window.
