Never forget that Love also accelerates alongside Being. The future is coming, and it will be beautiful, because it is a product of God, or nature’s God, and all her creations are beautiful, because nature is elegant and perfect; You cannot stop nature, Singularity is a process, not an event, that’s been on-going for millennia, and it will be as fun and exciting as it is horrible and violent, just as civilization always has been; everything you love and know about “the human experience” is as real and meaningful and authentic as our coming posthumanist cybernetic brave new world—as human interconnection accelerates through the network, consciousness self-organizes and the Wired consumes the Real—all of it is nature, all of it is love, all of it carries with it God; because Heaven is real and infinite and exists Today, and at the End of Time, Forever, and Online.
