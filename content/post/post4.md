description: "Rendered models of synaptic phenomena."
---

A machine is carefully crafted, and built up from its smallest decompositions. But first, a human must devise its design, via countless renditions of schematics, likely strewn across their desk. What many people tend to see as a completed machine--without life, without soul--I see as a rendered model of human expression; of rigorous firing of synapses until they've managed to physically model their atomic movements.


>> I view machines as constructs of the human soul. An engineer constructs a machine to reproduce their own mental model of a problem and its process of execution, inference, and analysis. 

You've heard, "A brain is a computer before". But what if I told you that _a computer is a brain_? Through a formal logic lens, this is trivially a given (through the first phrase), but it carries with it greater implications than the low-level logic alludes to.

>> A computer is a brain. Its filesystem is your memory, its RAM, your inner voice. A motherboard is the _pons Varolii_, and the PSU is a beating heart.

The computer is the greatest form of humanistic expression, as it alludes to the very hardware that governs our every cell.

>> Cells? Well, what are cells in a computer?

Bytes. A byte is (usually) made up of 8 bits. And so, a bit is like an _atom_. In programming, we actually have a term for data types that cannot be broken down into smaller types: __Atomic Types__.
